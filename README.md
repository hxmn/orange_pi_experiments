OrangePi Experiments
========

This project is aimed to help laboratory staff controlling equipment with 
Orange PI single-board computer. 

Technologies are used to create this project:
* WebSockets with [Tornado server](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/). 
It's fastest way to send commands from browser to server and display current state.
* Bootstrap/jQuery for simple UI creation.
* [pysmbus](https://github.com/bjornt/pysmbus) for working with 
[i2c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) in python.
